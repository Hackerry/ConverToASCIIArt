This project contains a single file that can create ASCII art images from "black-and-white" jpeg or png pictures.
It is recommended to view the result in command-line or console with a black background, and white dot font.
If the console windows is too small, you can redirect the output to a file and copy paste the result.
Command line arguements:
  [picture file][node number][output file]
  -node number: how many pixels(square) a character can represent. Larger node number makes smaller picture and less accurete result.
